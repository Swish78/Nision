# Nision.s.s : ML Model Management and Deployment Platform

## Overview
Nision.s is a cloud-based SaaS application designed to manage, version, optimize, and deploy machine learning models efficiently. The platform aims to streamline the machine learning model lifecycle, enhancing collaboration among data science teams and improving model deployment efficiency.

## Features

- **Model Versioning:** Track and manage different versions of machine learning models, allowing users to revert to previous versions.
- **Automated Deployment:** Simplify the deployment process to production environments with a single-click deployment feature.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor key performance metrics of deployed models (e.g., accuracy, latency) in real time.
- **Basic Visualization Dashboard:** Visualize model performance metrics for easy comparison of different versions.
- **Team Collaboration:** Enable multiple users to access and work on models collaboratively with basic permissions management.
- **Model Upload and Storage:** Upload and securely store trained models in the cloud.
- **REST API for Predictions:** Provide an API endpoint for predictions, allowing integration with other applications.
- **User Authentication:** Secure access to the platform for authorized users.
- **Logging and Audit Trail:** Maintain logs of model changes, deployments, and user actions.
- **Data Pipeline Integration:** Integrate with external data sources for easy data ingestion and preprocessing.
- **Automated Retraining:** Set up a pipeline to retrain models based on new data periodically.
- **Documentation and Help:** A comprehensive guide to using the platform effectively.
